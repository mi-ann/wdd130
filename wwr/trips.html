                    <p>5 miles</p>
                    <p>Lunch included</p>
                    <p>
                      Every day on the Easy Section of the South Fork American is a relaxing day. You'll float through calm pools,
                      marvel at the beauty of the canyon, and every so often get your heart pumping a little faster when the current
                      picks up with Class II rapids. If you feel up to it, you might venture out of the raft and swim in the river 
                      or just float in your life jacket as the river carries you around the corner and towards the next riffle.
                      
                      On 1-Day Tom Sawyer trips we spend a lot time exploring and experiencing the river as a kid yearns to do.
                      Like Tom, weâ€™ll take extra time to enjoy our surroundings. When in season, we'll pick blackberries hanging off
                      the banks, watch a momma duck with her ducklings, swim in small rapids, and float along with a mask and 
                      snorkel looking for fish below. It all makes for an adventurous and satisfying day for kids and adults. 
                      Lunch along the river is a treat and those who want more excitement and adventure in a smaller water craft 
                      can enjoy kayaking instruction.
                      
                      *The itinerary above may be altered due to a range of variables, including river flow levels, water release 
                      schedules, time of year, and other factors. Contact us if you have any questions.

                    <p>Your trip begins quickly in the Class IV boulder slalom of Rock Garden Rapid. The next four miles bring an 
                      onslaught of technical, intricate Class IV+ rapids with large hydraulics and immense boulders. Soon you'll 
                      reach Class IV+ Clavey Falls, a legendary rapid due to its sheer drop and intimidating hydraulics.</p>
                    <p> After Clavey, the water mellows to an enjoyable Class II-III level, giving you an opportunity to look beyond 
                      the whitewater in front of you and take in the grace and beauty of the Tuolumne canyon. We'll stop for a delicious, well-earned riverside lunch on a relaxing beach. Back on the water, soon you'll be crashing 
                      and careening through more Class IV whitewater. Just when you're getting tired, we'll pull into take-out.</p>

                       rapid of the day--Troublemaker. After Troublemaker, we break for lunch in the Marshall Gold Discovery State
